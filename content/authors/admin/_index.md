I am a 2nd-year M.S. student in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park.  I work with Doug Oard in the CLIP lab.  I also work with Matt Post at the HLTCOE at Johns Hopkins University.  My research interests are primarily in natural language processing and extend to artificial intelligence and lingustics.  I am interested particularly in multi-/cross-linguality and second-language acquisition.  Recently, I have been working on projects in machine translation evaluation, speech translation, and information retrieval.  I plan to begin a Ph.D. program in Fall 2021.
