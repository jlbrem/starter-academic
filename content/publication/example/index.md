abstract: "We present the Multilingual TEDx corpus, built to support speech
  recognition (ASR) and speech translation (ST) research across many non-English
  source languages. The corpus is a collection of audio recordings from TEDx
  talks in 8 source languages. We segment transcripts into sentences and align
  them to the source-language audio and target-language translations. The corpus
  is released along with open-sourced code enabling extension to new talks and
  languages as they become available. Our corpus creation methodology can be
  applied to more languages than previous work, and creates multi-way parallel
  evaluation sets. We provide baselines in multiple ASR and ST settings,
  including multilingual models to improve translation performance for
  low-resource language pairs. "
