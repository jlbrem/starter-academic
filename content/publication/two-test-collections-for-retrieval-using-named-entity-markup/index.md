abstract: Studying the effects of semantic analysis on retrieval effectiveness
  can be difficult using standard test collections because both queries and
  documents typically lack semantic markup. This paper describes extensions to
  two test collections, CLEF 2003/2004 Russian and TDT-3 Chinese, to support
  study of the utility of named entity annotation. A new set of topic aspects
  that were expected to benefit from named entity markup were defined for topics
  in those test collections, with two queries for each aspect. One of these
  queries uses named entities as bag-of-words query terms or as semantic
  constraints on a free-text query term; the other is a bag-of-words baseline
  query without named entity markup. Exhaustive judgment of the documents
  annotated by CLEF or TDT as relevant to each corresponding topic was
  performed, resulting in relevance judgments for 133 Russian and 33 Chinese
  topic aspects that each have at least one relevant document. Named entity tags
  were automatically generated for the documents in both collections. Use of the
  test collections is illustrated with some preliminary experiments.
