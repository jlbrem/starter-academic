abstract: "This paper presents the Johns Hopkins University submission to the
  2020 Duolingo Shared Task on Simultaneous Translation and Paraphrase for
  Language Education (STAPLE). We participated in all five language tasks,
  placing first in each. Our approach involved a language-agnostic pipeline of
  three components: (1) building strong machine translation systems on
  general-domain data, (2) fine-tuning on Duolingo-provided data, and (3)
  generating n-best lists which are then filtered with various score-based
  techniques. In addition to the language-agnostic pipeline, we attempted a
  number of linguistically-motivated approaches, with, unfortunately, little
  success. We also find that improving BLEU performance of the beam-search
  generated translation does not necessarily improve on the task metricâ€”weighted
  macro F1 of an n-best list."
